# Food At Your Service

#### by Allison Kwan and Annie Ye (https://github.com/annie-ye)


## Description
We created this trivia game to help educate others and help find accessible food and water resources in local areas for users in need, to promote the overall health of our community. It is unlike Google Maps or Yelp because it offers affordable resources rather than restaurants or facilities that may not be accessible to users. We are passionate about this because we believe basic resources and needs should be easily accessible for anyone. For the future, we would like to develop another part of the program where users could select if they want food/water materials or health materials.
